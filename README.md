# Sandpiper

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Golang
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Give the example
```

#### PostgreSQL Database

##### Windows

https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

To start/stop service, run `pg_ctl start`, `pg_ctl stop`.

create the sandpiper database:

db_create.bat (enter the master postgres user password)

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Endpoints

The application runs as an HTTP server at port 8080. It provides the following RESTful endpoints:

* `POST /login`: accepts username/passwords and returns jwt token and refresh token
* `GET /refresh/:token`: refreshes sessions and returns jwt token
* `GET /me`: returns info about currently logged in user
* `GET /swaggerui/` (with trailing slash): launches swaggerui in browser
* `GET /v1/users`: returns list of users
* `GET /v1/users/:id`: returns single user
* `POST /v1/users`: creates a new user
* `PATCH /v1/password/:id`: changes password for a user
* `DELETE /v1/users/:id`: deletes a user

You can log in as admin to the application by sending a post request to localhost:8080/login with username `admin` and password `admin` in JSON body.


## Project Structure

1. Root directory contains things not related to code directly, e.g. docker-compose, CI/CD, readme, bash scripts etc. It may also contain vendor folder.

2. Cmd package contains code for starting applications (main packages). The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to have. Sandpiper is structured as a monolith application but can be restructured to contain multiple microservices. We use the Go convention of placing main package as a subdirectory of the cmd package. As an example, scheduler application's binary would be located under cmd/cron. It also loads the necessary configuration and passes it to the service initializers.

3. Rest of the code is located under /pkg. The pkg directory contains `utl` and 'microservice' directories.

4. Microservice directories, like api (naming corresponds to `cmd/` folder naming) contains multiple folders for each domain it interacts with, for example: user, car, appointment etc.

5. Domain directories, like "user", contain all application/business logic and two additional directories: "platform" and "transport".

6. Platform folder contains various packages that provide support for things like databases, authentication and marshaling. Most of the packages located under platform are decoupled by using interfaces. Every platform has its own package, for example, postgres, elastic, redis, memcache etc.

7. Transport package contains HTTP handlers. The package receives the requests, marshals, validates then passes it to the corresponding service.

8. Utl directory contains helper packages and models. Packages such as mock, middleware, configuration, server are located here.

### Implementing CRUD of another table

Let's say you have a table named 'cars' that handles employee's cars. To implement CRUD on this table you need:

1. Inside `internal/model` create a new file named `car.go`. Inside put your entity (struct), and methods on the struct if you need them.

2. Create a new `car` folder in the (micro)service where your service will be located, most probably inside `api`. Inside create a file/service named car.go and test file for it (`car/car.go` and `car/car_test.go`). You can test your code without writing a single query by mocking the database logic inside /mock/mockdb folder. If you have complex queries interfering with other entities, you can create in this folder other files such as car_users.go or car_templates.go for example.

3. Inside car folder, create folders named `platform`, `transport` and `logging`.

4. Code for interacting with a platform like database (postgresql) should be placed under `car/platform/pgsql`. (`pkg/api/car/platform/pgsql/car.go`)

5. In `pkg/api/car/transport` create a new file named `http.go`. This is where your handlers are located. Under the same location create http_test.go to test your API.

6. In logging directory create a file named `car.go` and copy the logic from another service. This serves as request/response logging.

6. In `pkg/api/api.go` wire up all the logic, by instantiating car service, passing it to the logging and transport service afterwards.

### Implementing other platforms

Similarly to implementing APIs relying only on a database, you can implement other platforms by:

1. In the service package, in car.go add interface that corresponds to the platform, for example, Indexer or Reporter.

2. Rest of the procedure is same, except that in `/platform` you would create a new folder for your platform, for example, `elastic`.

3. Once the new platform logic is implemented, create an instance of it in main.go (for example `elastic.Client`) and pass it as an argument to car service (`pkg/api/car/car.go`).

### Running database queries in transaction

To use a transaction, before interacting with db create a new transaction:

```go
err := s.db.RunInTransaction(func (tx *pg.Tx) error{
    // Application service here
})
````

Instead of passing database client as `s.db` , inside this function pass it as `tx`. Handle the error accordingly.
